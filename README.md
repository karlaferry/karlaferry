## 👋🏼 Hello there!

My name is **Karla** (_Ferry socially, Carreon legally_) and I'm a Junior Software Engineer & Mentor at [Northcoders](http://northcoders.com), and I like building things.

When I'm not coding, I'm either reading a book, playing something on my Nintendo Switch, or bingeing something on Netflix. I'm a huge fan of occasional naps as well. 💤

- 📚 **Currently Reading**: Tender is the Flesh by Agustina Bazterrica

- 📺 **Currently Watching**: The Office (US)

## 💻 Coding Journey

I started self-teaching in May 2021, enrolled at Northcoders in October of the same year and completed it in February 2022.

I've always been passionate about the tech field and building things through coding, and I can't wait to learn more technologies and be able to build more cool things.
