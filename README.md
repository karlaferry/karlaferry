# 👋🏼 Hello there!

My name is **Karla** (_Ferry socially, Carreon legally_) and I'm a Junior Developer at [SaleCycle](https://www.salecycle.com/), and I like building things.

When I'm not coding, I'm either reading a book, playing something on my Nintendo Switch, or bingeing something on Netflix. I'm a huge fan of occasional naps as well. 💤

- 📚 **Currently Reading**: The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up by Marie Kondo
- 🎮 **Currently Playing**: _Horizon: Zero Dawn_
- 📺 **Currently Watching**: You (the show You on Netflix, not you _you_, that would be creepy)

## 💻 Coding Journey

I started self-teaching in May 2021, enrolled at Northcoders in October of the same year and completed it in February 2022.

I've always been passionate about the tech field and building things through coding, and I can't wait to learn more technologies and be able to build more cool things.

### ✨ Current Tech Skills

- **Language/s**: JavaScript, TypeScript
- **Frontend**: ReactJS, HTML5, CSS3
- **Backend**: NodeJS, ExpressJS, SQL (PostgreSQL, mySQL), RESTful APIs
- **Testing**: Jest, Supertest
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## ⚙️ Currently Working On
