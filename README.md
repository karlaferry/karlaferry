## 👋🏼 Hello there!

My name is **Karla** (_Ferry socially, Carreon legally_) and I'm a trainee software developer at [Northcoders](http://northcoders.com), and I like building things.

When I'm not coding, I'm either reading a book, playing something on my Nintendo Switch, or bingeing something on Netflix. I'm a huge fan of occasional naps as well. 💤

- 📚 **Currently Reading**: Children of TIme by Adrian Tchaikovsky
- 🎮 **Currently Playing**: _scouting for next game!_
- 📺 **Currently Watching**: The Office (US)

## 💻 Coding Journey

I started self-teaching in May 2021 and enrolled at Northcoders in October of the same year. I've always been passionate about the tech field and building things through coding, and I can't wait to learn more technologies and be able to build more cool things.
