## 👋🏼 Hello there!

My name is **Karla** (_Ferry socially, Carreon legally_) and I'm a Junior Software Engineer & Mentor at [Northcoders](http://northcoders.com), and I like building things.

When I'm not coding, I'm either reading a book, playing something on my Nintendo Switch, or bingeing something on Netflix. I'm a huge fan of occasional naps as well. 💤

- 📚 **Currently Reading**: The Colour of Magic by Terry Pratchett
- 🎮 **Currently Playing**: _Horizon: Zero Dawn_
- 📺 **Currently Watching**: Just finished The Boys!

## 💻 Coding Journey

I started self-teaching in May 2021, enrolled at Northcoders in October of the same year and completed it in February 2022.

I've always been passionate about the tech field and building things through coding, and I can't wait to learn more technologies and be able to build more cool things.

### ✨ Current Tech Skills

- **Language/s**: Javascript
- **Frontend**: ReactJS, HTML5, CSS3
- **Backend**: NodeJS, ExpressJS, SQL (PostgreSQL, mySQL), RESTful APIs
- **Testing**: Jest, Supertest
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## ⚙️ Currently Working On

- Building a birthday app using Firebase Realtime Database, Auth, and Storage
- Learning Typescript
- Learning how to use Frontity, a ReactJS framework that uses Wordpress CMS (desperate to build my own blog!)
